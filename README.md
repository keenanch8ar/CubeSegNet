# CubeSegNet

CubeSegNet is a project focused on developing a deep learning model for semantic segmentation of images captured by nanosatellites, specifically 1U, 2U, and 6U CubeSats. The model aims to improve the efficiency of data downlink by prioritizing important image data over less critical information.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of CubeSegNet, a variant of SegNet tailored for CubeSat image processing. The model is designed to run onboard CubeSats, enabling real-time image analysis and data prioritization.

## Features

- **CubeSat Image Processing:** Process images captured by CubeSats to extract meaningful information.
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Classify each pixel in an image to identify objects or regions of interest.
- **Onboard Data Prioritization:** Use machine learning to prioritize image data for efficient downlink.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/CubeSegNet.git
cd CubeSegNet
pip install -r requirements.txt
